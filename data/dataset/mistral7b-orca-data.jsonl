However, we needed a camera, a printer and a device to connect the two and we did not have sufficient budget. As a result, we bought an ESP32-cam which came with a small camera and a Bluetooth thermal printer. I applied various libraries and techniques to convert images into dithered formats suitable for printing on a Bluetooth thermal printer and implemented image processing algorithms for real-time decoding of snapshots captured from the ESP32-cam microcontroller.
